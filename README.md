Modelo Latex - Projeto IC FAPESP
===

<img src="https://mjsaldanha.com/images/elf_icon.png" width="128" height="128">

This latex model was used in a project that was submitted and accepted by FAPESP.

This model was not published with the aim of having other people use it.
However, the model is public and the license allows unrestricted use.

This is **not** an official model.
Use at your own risk.

See the project PDF [here](./projeto.pdf).

See the Overleaf project [here](https://v2.overleaf.com/read/fgqknpqgsswb). I'll publish as a template as soon as Overleaf allows.
